    Google::Travel::Matrix - To access the Google Distance Matrix API .

VERSION
    version 0.2

  origins
       An address string,  or string of addresses. Each address element must
       be delimited by a comma. If more than one address, then seperate each
       address with a '|'. 
       An address HashRef of this format 
       {
        address_1 => $address_1,
        address_2 => $address_2,
        city => $city,
        state => $state, 
        country => $country,
        zip => $zip, 
        }
        ,  will be coerced to a valid address string.
           An arrayref of address strings and or address HashRefs  will be coerced into a compatible address(s)
           string(s).

  destinations
    The destination addresses. Follows the same formatting rules as 'origins'
  get_raw_google_matrix_data
    Builds the request and gets the Google Distance Matrix data based on the 
    Origin and Destination addresses.
    Returns the raw Google Matrix response in either JSON or XML format.
  get_google_matrix_data_as_scalar_ref
    Builds the request and gets the Google Distance Matrix data based on the 
    Origin and Destination addresses.
    Returns the Google Matrix response as a scalar reference to a Perl data structure.
    Note: The output attribute will be set to the default, "JSON".
  get_all_elements
 Given the Google Distance Matrix output as a scalar reference to a Perl data
 structure, returns an ArrayRef of Matrix elements or undef.
 If no Google Output data passed, then it will create one using the Origin and
 destination addresses;
 It would be a good idea to check that the Google Matrix Return is 'OK' before calling
 this method.
  convert_google_json_to_perl
   Convert the Google response from JSON to a Perl data reference.
  get_matrix_status_message
  Given the decoded Google response, return a string wich contains the google
  status message as a string.
      These are the status messages from Google.
      'OK',
      'INVALID_REQUEST',
      'MAX_ELEMENTS_EXCEEDED',
      'MAX_DIMENSIONS_EXCEEDED',
      'MAX_QUERY_LIMIT',
      'REQUEST_DENIED',
      'UNKNOWN_ERROR',

  get_matrix_origin_addresses
 Get the origin address(s) returned by Google.
 Returns an ArayRef;
  get_matrix_destination_addresses
 Get the destination address(s) returned by Google.
 Returns an ArayRef;
  _get_array_of_origins
    Returns the string of the original input origins as an arrayRef of individual addresses.
  _get_array_of_destinations
    Returns the string of the original input destinations as an arrayRef of individual addresses.
  _matrix_query_params
    Build and returns all the params for the Google Distance Matrix request
    as a HashRef.
    Use the formatted origins and destinations address's.
    Omits the requested output format specifier.
  _build_uri
   Build and return the query URI.
  _call_google_api
   Call the google travel matrix API.
   Returns the Google response.
  _convert_from_json
   Convert the Google response from JSON.
